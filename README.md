# Morphing wallpaper

Simply morph from login screen to desktop background

<img src="jesus-small.gif" width="768">

This is a low res version, done by passing the x,y of Jesus face into the shapemorph script from [Fred Weinhaus](http://www.fmwconcepts.com/imagemagick/)

His script, and the borrowed images were under a non-commercial license

I'm afraid the fullsize gif is 145mb â€” too large for github.  I include the start and end images instead

flying-dog.gif is just for fun

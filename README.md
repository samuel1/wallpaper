# Morphing wallpaper

Simply morph from login screen to desktop background

<img src="jesus-small.gif" width="768">

This is a low res version

It's done by passing the x,y of Jesus face into the shapemorph script from [Fred Weinhaus](http://www.fmwconcepts.com/imagemagick/).  His script, and the borrowed images are under a non-commercial license

I'm afraid the fullsize wallpaper is too large for github.  I've included it's start and end images instead

flying-dog.gif is just for fun

## Usage
To set the wallpaper at login, I use:
`gifview -a +e -w root ~/Pictures/wallpaper/jesus.gif &`
